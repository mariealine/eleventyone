      <p>To get your own instance of this <a href="https://11ty.io">11ty</a> starter project cloned and deploying to <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> very quickly, just click the button below and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/twavatar"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a></p>
<h2>Wait, what happens when I click that button?</h2>
<p>Good question. Here's what it will do...</p>
<ol>
<li>Netlify will clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. You will be asked for the required permissions to add the repo for you.</li>
<li>They'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.</li>
<li>That's it really.</li>
</ol>
