### Weekendesk
Product Designer, since August 2018

As soon as I arrived at Weekendesk, I started working on redesigning the Weekendesk experience.
Today, [the new mobile version is online](http://m.weekendesk.fr).

What I aldready did in th last 18 months and what I am proud of :
- Implementation of a product design workflow with [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) and [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) (versioning, storage, collaboration)
- Set up design ceremonies: design reviews, design presentations, design meetings.
- Responsability of Product Design
- Establishment of collaboration and processes with Product Managers based on user behavior, data, etc.
- Creating the Design System from a Sketch Design Library to shared documentation with front-end developers

I created Design Systems France to meet my needs to get inspired by my peers and learn from their experience.
